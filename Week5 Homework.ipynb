    "In this analysis of a modern adaptation of Fisher's Tea Experiment, you‚Äôll be testing whether STA130 students can distinguish the order of milk and tea pouring. The approach includes:"

    "1. Introduction - Describe the original experiment by Fisher and relate it to this one with STA130 students."
    "2. Hypotheses "
       "- Null Hypothesis (H0): The probability of correctly identifying the pouring order is 0.5, indicating random guessing."
       "- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The probability differs from 0.5, suggesting an ability to differentiate."
    "3. Quantitative Analysis - Perform a Z-test for proportions using the sample of 80 students, with 49 identifying correctly."
    "4. Code & Reproducibility - Use Python to calculate the Z statistic and p-value, ensuring reproducibility with `np.random.seed()`."
    "5. Optional Visualization - Consider using a KDE plot to illustrate the sampling distribution under H0."
    "6. Findings & Conclusion - Interpret the p-value to determine if there's significant evidence to reject H0, and discuss limitations and possible next steps."
